Learning to program is about understanding how to translate thoughts into source code that can be executed on computers to achieve one or more goals.

There are many steps in learning how to program, including
1. setting up a [index](../Development%20Environments/📍Development%20Environments.md)
2. selecting a programming language
3. understanding the syntax and commands for the language
4. writing code in the language, often using libraries and framewroks
5. executing the program
6. debugging errors and testing for unexpected results
7. deploying an application so it can run for intended users

## How should I learn programming?
There are several schools of thought on how a person should start learning to program. One school of thought is that a lower-level programming language such as Assembly or C are the most appropriate languages to start with because they force new developers to write their own data structures, learn about pointers and generally work their way through the hard problems in computer science.

The atomic units of progress in the lower level first method of learning are
1.  aspects of programming language understood (type systems, syntax)
2.  number of data structures coded and able to be used (stacks, queues)
3.  algorithms in a developer's toolbelt (quicksort, binary search)

Another school of thought is that new developers should bootstrap themselves through working on projects in whatever programming language interests them enough to keep working through the frustrations that will undoubtably occur.

In this "project-based" line of thinking, the number of projects completed that expand a programmer's abilities are the units of progress. Extra value is placed on making the projects open source and working with experienced mentors to learn what he or she can improve on in their programs.

## Practice problems
Working on practice programming challenges and studying their solutions in Python or another language is a great way to learn whether you are just starting or an experienced developer. Here are numerous open source repositories and sites with practice problems and solutions:
-   [Pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes) are an awesome collection of Python programs to practice and demonstrate skills. These problems go above and beyond the common data structures and algorithm questions often found in other practice problem sets.
    
-   [Interactive Python coding interview challenges](https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges) is an awesome [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.fullstackpython.com/jupyter-notebook.html) to learn and test your data structures and algorithms knowledge in Python.
    
-   [Kindling project](https://nedbatchelder.com/text/kindling.html) provides a wonderful list of resources that challenge beginners with programming problems that beginners can solve to grow their skills.
    
-   [Build your own "x"](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x) does not contain practice problems but instead provides tutorials for how to build your own programming languages, blockchain, [bots](https://www.fullstackpython.com/bots.html), [databases](https://www.fullstackpython.com/databases.html), [frameworks](https://www.fullstackpython.com/web-frameworks.html) and more awesome projects.
    
-   [Python Programming Exercises](http://joaoventura.net/static/files/python_exercises_book.pdf) is a free short PDF book with exercises across many standard Python language features such as dictionaries, classes and functions.
    
-   [Code problems](https://github.com/blakeembrey/code-problems) provides common algorithm and data structures challenges with solutions in several programming languages including Python.
    
-   [Python basics](https://pythonbasics.org/) contains materials and exercises to learn basic Python 3 syntax such as variables, functions and lists.
    
-   [TeachCraft](https://teachcraft.net/) combines Minecraft with Python to learn coding.
