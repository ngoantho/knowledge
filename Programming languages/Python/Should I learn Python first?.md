Python is good choice in the project-based approach because of the extensive availability of [free and low cost introductory resources](https://www.fullstackpython.com/best-python-resources.html), many of which provide example projects to build upon.

Note that this question of whether or not Python is a good first language for an aspiring programmer is highly subjective and these approaches are not mutually exclusive. Python is also widely taught in universities to explain the fundamental concepts in computer science, which is in line with the "low-level first" philosophy than the projects-first method.

In a nutshell, whether Python is the right first language to learn is up to personal preference. Programming languages, and the ecosystems around them, are human-made constructs. Just find one that appears to match personal style.
